## ðŸ“Œ services-customization

This script guides the user through setting up basic services using Docker.
1. User Input:
  - The script prompts the user to confirm the installation of various services like `wg-easy`, `Nextcloud`, `Uptime Kuma`, `Rocket.Chat`, `MongoDB`, `Homer`, `Portainer`, and `Taiga`.
  - It also asks for specific credentials required for some services, such as `wg-easy` and `Taiga`.
2. Environment File Creation:
  - Based on user input, the script creates a `.env` file in the docker directory, storing the provided credentials.
3. Service Deployment:
  - Finally, the script runs Docker Compose to deploy the selected services.
